      <h1>difference between local and session storage</h1>
      <p>
        A browsing session approximates your use of a website. If you visit a
        site, browse around for a bit, then turn off your computer, you can
        think of that time as a single session. Your browser configuration may
        change this in subtle ways, but a session aims to represent the chunk of
        time you interact with a site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Local storage maintains data across all instances of a site, whether
        they're in different tabs or windows. It is also permanent, so the data
        won't disappear when you close your browser. When you open a website
        that previously used local storage, it will always have access to that
        stored data.
      </p>
      <h1>difference between global and block scope</h1>
      <p>
        The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are
        known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that
        the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
        function or conditional state can access that variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you were to define some variables inside curly brackets {} or inside
        a specific function then those variables are called local variables The
        local variables have a very confined scope which is called the local
        scope But, with the release of ES6, the local scope was further broken
        down into two different scopes: Function scope, Block scope.

      <h1>event loop of javascript</h1>
      <p>
        The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear
        before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the
        Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for
        available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack,
        waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same
        process.
      </p>
      <h1>ways to get undefined</h1>
      <p>
        Scenarios that create undefined <br />
        1. Uninitialized variable <br />
        2. Accessing a non-existing property <br />
        3. Function parameters <br />
        4. Function return value <br />
        5. void operator <br />
